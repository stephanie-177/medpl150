                Welcome to my MEDPL 150 portfolio site
            </p>
            <p>
                Ive always been drawn to all sorts of forms of media from music to art to movies but i've only truly started learning how to create digital media in highschool. Throughout those years I learned how much I truly enjoyed creating things that are representative of me and how I view the world, from little things like the way the world is with the beauty of simplicity through nature or from the complexity of people without having to put on a show and just enjoying everyday things. I gravitate to strong acts of self expression even if its not apparant and the clashing of concepts to show strong contrast.
