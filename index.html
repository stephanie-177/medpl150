                Welcome to my medpl150 portfolio site

                Ive always been drawn to all sorts of forms of media from music to art to movies but i've only truly started learning how to create digital media in highschool when I had to choose a tech pathway. My sophmore year was focused on using adobe illustrator and my junior year was adobe photoshop. During my senior year we focused on animation which was a lot more work. Throughout those years I learned how much I truly enjoyed creating things that are representative of me and how I view the world compared to other classmates.
